        <p>
            Breathe in. Breathe out. Breathing is an important action for our
            bodies. When we breathe in, we take in oxygen. Our cells need oxygen
            to continue functioning.

                But what if the air we breathe contains impurities? Sadly, this
                is already the case. Carbon dioxide, a simple asphyxiant (i.e.,
                a gas that displaces oxygen), is now more concentrated in the
                air we breathe. Due to industrialization, carbon dioxide
                concentrations are now 49% higher than normal.
            </p>

            <br /><br />

            <p>
                So, what does this mean for our bodies, particularly our brains?
                The short answer is that

        <p>
            Parts per million is a unit that measures concentration. It is
            defined as the "number of parts" of

            Effects of Carbon Dioxide on the Brain at Different Concentrations
        </h2>

        <h3 class="header">200ppm-300ppm</h3>

        <p>
            This was the average carbon dioxide concentration out in nature
            before the industrial revolution. At this level, there are no
            immediate effects on cognition.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">Around 400ppm</h3>

        <p>
            This is the present-day average carbon dioxide concentration out in
            nature. In reality, it is a little bit higher than that (417ppm as
            of December 2021).
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">500ppm-900ppm</h3>

        <p>
            In large cities, carbon dioxide concentrations can reach levels as
            high as these. At this point, there aren't any immediately harmful
            effects on a person's wellbeing; however, it has been shown that a
            person's decision-making skills are somewhat affected at these
            concentrations (Heid, 2012).
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">1000ppm-1400ppm (0.1% - 0.14%)</h3>

        <p>
            However, the story does not end there. In smaller, poorly ventilated
            spaces, such as schools, the carbon dioxide concentration can reach
            1000ppm. According to Scott & Baute (2019), we can observe a
            <b>15% decrease in cognitive function</b> at this level.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

        <p>
            At 1400ppm, we can observe a
            <b>50% decrease in cognitive function</b>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">2000ppm (0.2%)</h3>

        <p>
            Here, some <b>side effects</b> start to appear. These include
            nausea, loss of attention, and poor concentration, among others. The
            scary thing is that carbon dioxide levels of 2000ppm are relatively
            common. The concentration of carbon dioxide can reach 4000ppm in
            cars and bedrooms (Scott & Baute, 2019).
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">5000ppm (0.5%)</h3>

        <p>
            This is the <b>maximum limit</b> imposed by the Occupational Safety
            and Health Administration (OSHA) for the average carbon dioxide
            concentration over a period of <b>8 hours</b>. It is generally not
            advisable to do work at levels as high as these.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

        <p>
            Interestingly, in the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Nh_vxpycEA">video</a> I
            embedded at the start of this article, Kurtis Baute (the speaker)
            exposed himself to a carbon dioxide concentration of around 6500ppm.
            During the video, he can be seen struggling to remember parts of the
            script (<a href="https://youtu.be/1Nh_vxpycEA?t=149">2:29</a>). He
            also stated that he had to do multiple takes for the video because
            of the high carbon dioxide concentration (<a
                href="https://youtu.be/1Nh_vxpycEA?t=195"
                >3:15</a
            >).
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">10000ppm (1%)</h3>

        <p>
            Here, drowsiness is possible. Surprisingly, levels as high as these
            still occur in our everyday lives. For instance,
            <b>motorcycle helmets</b>
            can contain air with a carbon dioxide concentration of 10000ppm
            (1%). Now consider that these people not only have to breathe in air
            with a lot of carbon dioxide but also drive around a town or city.
            It is not an ideal situation to be in.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">30000ppm (3%)</h3>

        <p>
            This is the <b>maximum limit</b> recommended by the American
            Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) for the
            average carbon dioxide concentration over a period of
            <b>10 minutes</b>.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

        <p>
            At this level, there are also effects on other parts of the body,
            such as the <b>respiratory and circulatory systems</b>. Increased
            heart rate and blood pressure have been reported at these levels
            (ESHG, n.d.).
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">40000ppm (4%)</h3>

        <p>
            Levels these high are immediately dangerous and may result in death.
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">50000ppm (5%)</h3>

        <p>
            According to the FSIS Environmental Safety and Health Group [ESHG]
            (n.d.), exposure to these levels of concentration leads to "strong
            respiratory stimulation, dizziness, confusion, headache, [and]
            shortness of breath".
        </p>

        <h3 class="header">80000ppm (8%)</h3>

        <p>
            According to the FSIS Environmental Safety and Health Group [ESHG]
            (n.d.), exposure to these levels of concentration leads to "dimmed
            sight, sweating, tremor, unconsciousness, and possible death".

            With carbon dioxide concentrations
            <b
                >set to reach values as high as 695ppm by the end of this
                century</b
            >, our entire species may experience a <b>10-16% decrease</b> in our
            cognitive ability (Scott & Baute, 2019).
        </p>

        <br /><br />

        <p>
            This is rather concerning, however, there are things that we can do
            to lessen the detrimental effects of carbon dioxide in our lives.
            Here are some of the things that we can do:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Open a window</li>
            <li>Get some plants</li>
            <li>Check your ventilation systems</li>
            <li>Use fans to ventilate air around appliances</li>
        </ul>

        <br /><br />

        <p>
            In conclusion, due to climate change, carbon dioxide concentrations
            are increasing worldwide. This is worrying because high carbon
            dioxide concentrations have adverse effects on our bodies; however,
            there are many ways to counteract these negative effects, such as
            opening windows, getting some plants, etc.
        </p>

        <br /><br />

        <p>
            So open a window and let the fresh air in! Breathe in. Breathe out.
        </p>
