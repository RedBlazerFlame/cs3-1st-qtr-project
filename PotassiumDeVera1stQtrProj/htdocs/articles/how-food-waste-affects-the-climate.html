    outlines how food waste negatively affects the climate
</p>

<h2 class="header">Introduction</h2>
<p>
    When you hear the phrase <i>climate change</i>, what do you think of?
    Greenhouse gases? Fossil fuels? Many people think of these as the primary
    causes of climate change, and they would be right! However, there is one
    cause of climate change that I think most people are not aware of, and that
    cause is <b>food waste</b>.
</p>

<h2 class="header">What is food waste?</h2>
<p>
    Food waste occurs when <b>edible food</b> is <b>thrown away</b>. Food waste
    is a problem that occurs at the consumer level. Food waste includes not only
    throwing away good food but also the expiration of otherwise edible food.
    And yes, this means that that piece of fried chicken that expired because
    you forgot to take it out of the refrigerator is considered food waste, so
    you might want to
    <b>think twice before buying food that you do not need</b>.
</p>

<h2 class="header">How much does Food Waste Affect the Climate?</h2>
<p>
    Food waste is a big problem in our present society. According to Vox (2017),
    <b>40%</b> of food produced in the USA <b>never gets eaten</b>. I want to
    let that number sink in for a moment. The energy spent to produce 40% of our
    food is simply wasted. According to Vox (2021), "if global food waste were a
    country, it would be the <b>third-largest emitter of greenhouse gases</b>,
    just behind China and the United States". What's even worse is that
    <b>12.5% of Americans do not have a steady supply of food</b>. Just imagine
    how much hungry people we could feed with all of this wasted food.
</p>

<h2 class="header">What causes Food Waste?</h2>
<h3 class="header">Expiration of Food</h3>
<p>
    One cause of food waste is the <b>expiration of food</b>. Food usually
    expires because people forget to eat them. When food goes into a
    non-transparent refrigerator, we tend to forget that the food is still
    there.
</p>

<h3 class="header">Getting more Food than we can Eat</h3>
<p>
    According to Vox (2021), "the average <b>dinner plate</b> has
    <b>grown by 36%</b> since 1960". This larger plate encourages people to put
    more food on their plate, regardless of whether they can finish it or not.
</p>

<h2 class="header">What can we do to Lessen Food Waste?</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Only buy food that you need.</b> Sometimes, we tend to buy more than
        we can eat just so that we can have the option to eat at any time;
        however, this approach will lead to more wasted food. Only buying the
        food you need will help reduce the amount of food that expires in your
        household.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b
            >Invest in smaller transparent refrigerators that allow you to see
            the food.</b
        >
        With smaller refrigerators, you can condition ourselves to not buy as
        much food. Transparent refrigerators will also let us see what is inside
        of it, which would make you more aware of the food that we still need to
        consume.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Buy smaller plates.</b> Buying smaller plates will encourage you to
        put less food on your plate. This would reduce the amount of food that
        you leave on the plate simply because you are too full to eat it.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Try out food donations.</b> There are apps such as
        <a href="https://www.gocopia.com/">Copia&trade;</a> that make food
        donation fast and easy. By donating food to people who need it, you not
        only reduce food waste but also help stop world hunger.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="header">Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    It may seem like something as big as climate change cannot be easily fixed.
    While it is a challenge to fix such a large issue, we can still do simple
    things to at least try to mitigate it. We have seen that reducing food waste
    is one of the easiest ways to help solve the problem of climate change.
    Through smaller transparent refrigerators, smaller plates, and food
    donations, we can help society deal with the problem of climate change.
