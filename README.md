# cs3-1st-qtr-project
This is a project I have for Computer Science 3. This is a website called "climate-post". It is a website that focuses on spreading awareness on issues on the climate. Note that this project makes use of NodeJS for routing, and so **simply opening the html files will not work**. Instead, please go to [this link](https://climate-post.herokuapp.com/). Also, please note that the folder structure may not necessarily mirror the routes on the website.
